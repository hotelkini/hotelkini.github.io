<div><div><h4>Company Overview</h4></div><div><div><span><div><div>
<div><strong>About Us:</strong></div>
<div>
<div>Compass Offices provides flexible workspace (fitted and furnished offices), meeting facilities and virtual office solutions (for home/road workers) in high-quality office buildings in CBDs and business hubs around Asia Pacific. Our clients are predominantly small local businesses, medium-sized enterprises with international foot prints, and sometimes multi-national companies with complex requirements for work space.</div>
<div>Our story began in 2009 when Andrew Chung, a veteran entrepreneur in Asia, experienced inconsistent, not so transparent pricing and poor services from existing serviced office providers.</div>
<div>He decided to provide an alternative solution to the existing serviced office industry. He believed that customers desire to experience a service with transparent pricing that is not just reliable, but also delivers a business community where they can learn, grow and safe for their businesses.</div>
<div>He founded Compass Offices. The company is built around supporting the needs of the clients. One Centre in Hong Kong has now grown into over 30 centres located in 9 cities across Asia Pacific with more than 300 employees.</div>
<div>To us, we want to provide clients with more than just offices. We want to be our customers' partners. We are proudly supporting their business.<br>
&#160;<br>
We strongly believe that our success has come from an unyielding practice of facilitating transparent relationships with our diverse range of clients. We are differentiated in our growing industry through our genuine interest to partner with our clients, rather than taking an inflexible landlord stance. We see ourselves as pioneers in Asia&#8217;s serviced office industry, and our clients have validated our business model by allowing us to grow from inception in 2009 to a business of over 7 countries &#8211;with plenty more opportunity for growth across the globe.</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div><strong>Our Mission:</strong></div>
<div>Be the best versions of ourselves.<br>
&#160;</div>
<div><strong>Our Vision:</strong></div>
<div>Make Compass a great place to work.</div>
</div>
</div></div></span></div></div></div>
