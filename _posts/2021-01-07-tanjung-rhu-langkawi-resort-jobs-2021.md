### About
Our 5-star accommodation stands at the northern tip of Langkawi, Malaysia. It is nestled in the cool shade of rustling Casuarina trees on a 2.5 km white-sand beach kissed by the aquamarine waters of the Andaman Sea. 

Located just beyond Pantai Pasir Hitam, Tanjung Rhu has one of Langkawi’s best shorelines. The waters are as clear as crystal, the sand is powder-fine and driving towards this beach you’ll have to pass a dense corridor of jungle.
